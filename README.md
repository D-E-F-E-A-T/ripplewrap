# ripplewrap
The #1 Ripple API wrapper.
# Cons
1. POST endpoints aren't included
2. Not written in TS (TypeScript)
# Pros
1. Unlike RippleAPI we don't define a bunch of functions
2. Only built-in libraries are used
# Install
`npm i ripplewrap`
# Docs
You can see the folder right? -_-
# TODO
